# Honeywell Assessment UWP
## Welcome to the Windows Mobile Engineer Assessment!
### Objective
The goal of this assessment is to create a simple UWP application using C# and XAML that displays a list of items and allows users to add and remove items from the list. Each element of the list should have 3 parameters: name, color coding, and either an image or a photo. Users should have the capacity to modify each parameter of each item.
To successfully complete this assessment, you will need to implement the MVVM design pattern and follow UWP UI design principles and Fluent Design System. 
### Instructions
- Implement the MVVM design pattern in your application. This will involve creating separate models, views, and view models for your app.
+ Use UWP UI design principles to create a simple and intuitive user interface. This will involve designing a list view to display items, creating a form for adding new items, and providing controls for modifying existing items.
* Use the Fluent Design System to create a visually appealing user interface that follows Microsoft's design principles.
- Implement the functionality for adding and removing items from the list, as well as modifying existing items. This will involve creating data binding between your UI controls and your view models, as well as creating functions to add, remove, and modify items in your list.
+ Ensure that each item in the list has three parameters: name, color coding, and an image or photo. Provide a selector for users to choose whether to attach an image or a photo to each item.
* Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This will involve checking that users can add, remove, and modify items in the list, and that the application is visually appealing and easy to use.
